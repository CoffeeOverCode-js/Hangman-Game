# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to run the game
If node modules folder is not found withing the directory open the cmd in the directory of the project and run the command npm install which will then in turn download the node modules folder.

Once you have confirmed the node modules folder is in the directory run the command npm start to start the project on your local device.

# How to use the game
The hangman game allow two inputs the keyboard provided on screen or you keyboard connected to your device.

The game goes as follows: 
You are given a word that is hidden in white your objective is to succesfully guess the word without allowing teh stickman in the image above to be hanged.

With every letter guessed incorrectly a new line is constructed starting from the pole them to the stickmans head, torso, arms and legs

If the word is guessed correctly you will then recieve a new word with 1000 score points added to your score. The game will end once the man has been hanged.

# Things to not about the game 
When you have succesfully entered the correct word a message will pop up saying you have won and that you need to click any button on your keyboard.

I suggest that you refrain fron pressing enter which in turn increases your score. When this message comes up click any letter on your keyboard not on the keyboard given.
